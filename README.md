## Ethereum Address

A simple library intended to group together functions validating an ethereum address. In simplest terms, the crate is a `rust` rewrite of [ethers.js](https://github.com/ethers-io/ethers.js/tree/master/packages/address) ethereum address utilities.

It is written in [rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).
